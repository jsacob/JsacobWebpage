      Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a 21-year-old software developer who's passionate about
      learning, building, and constantly improving. Over the past year, I've
      been working on projects with languages and technologies like TypeScript,
      JavaScript, React, Tailwind, C, and currently Rust . I enjoy finding
      creative solutions to challenging problems. I'm curious about many things,
      from programming and higher-level math to exploring some aspects of
      hardware engineering like designing my own PCB at some point. I really
      enjoy learning new skills and seeing how different areas of tech come
      together. While I'm currently based near Montreal, Canada, I plan to
      permanently reside in Houston, Texas in the very close future to be part
      of the thriving tech community there and take the next steps in my career.
      Outside of programming, I spend my time diving into personal projects,
      sharpening my problem-solving skills, and exploring new areas of tech.
